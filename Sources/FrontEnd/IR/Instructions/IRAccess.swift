/// Creates an access on a storage.

/// Hylo IR uses a capability system to govern storage accesses. To read/write values from/to
/// memory, one must acquire a capability on the storage matching the desired effect. For example,
/// a `set` capability is required to initialize storage. These capabilties can only be formed by
/// executing an `access` instruction and they must be eventually released using `end_access`.
/// During IR analyis, the compiler verifies that the instructions do not violate the rights and
/// duties associated with each acquired capability.
///
/// It is possible to create accesses on "raw addresses" (those result from instructions allocating
/// memory or computing addresses) or on other accesses. For example, it is legal to form a `let`
/// access from an `inout` access.

  /// IR lowering cannot always determine the capability required to access storage, since this
  /// information is implicit in Hylo sources and depends on control flow. For example, calling a
  /// bundle may request the `let` or `sink` capability on the arguments depending on their future
  /// uses (or lack thereof). In these cases, IR lowering will emit `access` instructions with the
  /// set capabilities that may be inferred from the syntax. These instructions are expected to be
